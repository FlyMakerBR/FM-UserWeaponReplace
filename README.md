Why Alpha:
I'm not a good programmer, so this have some bugs. I hope the communty can help-me fix
 
Knowed Issues:
Only works with editor placed units (This is the main task to me. I really want this mod works with spawned units)
Some classes have ammo garbage (Not all original ammo as removed)
Hard coded addon (Just a big code needing a recycle, dont worry this will work on MP environment without conflict with variables)
 
If anyone found another bug please give me a feedback. I will really try to fix fast as i can.
